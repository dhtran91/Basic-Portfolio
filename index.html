                    Hi. My name is David Tran and I was born and raised in Houston. I like maintaining an active lifestyle by at least trying to workout 5 times a week. I like to play games and play with my two cats.

                    I did my prerequisites at Lone Star community college and University of Houston main campus. I received an assoicate of science at Lone Star before going to UT health science center - School of Nursing in 2015. Graduated in 2016 with a bachelor of science in nursing and I have been working as a nurse ever since.

                    I always had a interest for technology and programming, but my parents wanted me to pursue a career in the medical field. In 2017, I started learning coding on my own using sites such as pluralsight, codeschool, freecodecamp, w3school, and many more resources. The more I spent coding, the more I realized that I really like coding. I joined a UT coding bootcamp in April 2018 and that was when I wanted to make my new hobby a career.
