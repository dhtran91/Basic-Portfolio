                    Graduated from UT health science center - school of nursing in 2016 with a bachelor of science in nursing. I been working as a nurse ever since. I always had a interest for technology and coding but being in an asian household, my parents wanted me to pursue a medical career. In 2017, I started learning coding on my off days as a new hobby using sites such as pluralsight, codeschool, freecodecamp, w3school, and many other resources. I realized that I really like coding and the logic that goes behind software/web applications. I took a UT coding bootcamp and that was the deciding factor in switching career path.
